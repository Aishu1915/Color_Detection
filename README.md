# Color_Detection using Pandas and Opencv
We will be working with beautiful colors and you will get to know about the process of this project. Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, this is used in many tools and drawing apps.

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Quite simple right? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not that easy . Human eyes and brains are put together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names.

About the Python Project
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
